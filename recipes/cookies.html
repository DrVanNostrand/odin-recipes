    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Follow this recipe correctly, and you'll have made some delicious, chewy,
            chocolate chip cookies! Total time to make is about 30 minutes, including prep.
            At the end you'll have about two and a half dozen cookies!
        </p>

        <p>This is a beloved recipe in my family, originating with my great-great-great
            grandmother. She originally came up with the idea while rock climbing
            with then-president John Adams. Adams tasted the cookies and immediately
            issued an executive order which ratified the cookies into the constitution.
            And the rest, as they say, is history!
        </p>
