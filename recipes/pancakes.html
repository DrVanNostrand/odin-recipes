            I dreamt up this pancake recipe while camping in the majestic Great Smoky Mountains.
            While camping one night, a bear crept into our campground and stole all our cooking ingredients.
            I was distraught, but somehow kept my composure and was able to create the world's greatest pancakes using only the foraged forest ingredients around me.
            Incidentally, I didn't write that recipe down. However, THIS recipe, using common ingredients, is the closest I've come to replicating them.
